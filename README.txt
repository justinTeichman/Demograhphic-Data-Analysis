--About the System--

This system allows for a) retrieving demographic 
and other data for one selected country from the World Bankâ€™s data repository; b) processing, if
required, the data using different types of analyses, and c) rendering the retrieved data or the processed data
using appropriately selected visualization means such as bar charts, line graphs, scattered plots, and pie
charts. Example data which can be retrieved for a given country from the World Bank data repository is
health expenditures per 1,000 people, or percentage of population attended primary school.

The system has a main User Interface (UI) where all selections of parameters and the rendering of
the data are performed. 

--How to use the system--
You must use the first and last names (case senstitive) as the username and password for the system.
